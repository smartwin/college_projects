            <h2>The Boring Stuff</h2>
            <p> My career goal would be defined as working to build robotic things for the mentally and physically disabled. I want to be able to give people their independence. 
                Because robotics is a new and prospering field, I do not have a set path, I am currently majoring in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering.</p>

            <h2>The Fun Stuff</h2>
            <p> I love all kinds of music that doesn't sound like the artists is yelling at me. I also have a thing
                against music in languages I don't know, for obvious reasons.</p>
            <p>I'm not the kind of person who enjoys sitting in front of computer unless I have a clear, cut plan of what I am doing on said computer.
                However, I do have favorite website, which goes as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Quora: To see what other people are questioning</li>
                <li>Google: To settle any and all disagreements</li>
                <li>StumbleUpon: Becuase I feel like one day I will stumble up a website that will have all the answers to the universe.</li>
            </ul>
